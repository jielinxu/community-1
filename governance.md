> This is a Work In Progress, documenting how the Milvus community is being operated up to now.

### Principles

The Milvus community adheres to the following principles:

- **Open**: Milvus is open source. 
- **Welcoming and respectful**: See Code of Conduct below.
- **Transparent and accessible**: Work and collaboration should be done in public. 
- **Merit**: Ideas and contributions are accepted according to their technical merit and alignment with project objectives, scope, and design principles.

### Code of Conduct

The Milvus community abides by the [Milvus Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Here is an excerpt:

*In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.*

We highly value our community and spare no effort to cultivate a friendly and collaborative environment for all our community members and users.
